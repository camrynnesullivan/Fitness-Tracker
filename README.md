### Description

- This app creates and tracks workouts. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Mongo, and Mongoose to create this app.

#### User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

### Usage

- You will then open your camera- the camera icon on your phone. Next you will point your phone at the object you would like to take a picture of. Finally, you press the little white circle at the bottom of your screen. Check to see the photo in your Photos App.
